## Project Background

This was a independent analysis project focused on applying my Tableau skills to visualize key business insights.
The goal was to support the company by evaluating its operational performance and identifying opportunities to boost profitability and prevent financial decline.

## Executive Summary

This analysis highlights key opportunities to boost profitability through targeted sales, marketing, and operational strategies. While certain product categories and regions are performing well, others consistently generate losses and require reevaluation. Strategic advertising during peak periods and in high-performing states can improve returns, while addressing high return rates and customer behavior issues will help reduce unnecessary losses. Continued focus on optimizing what works and eliminating inefficiencies will support long-term growth and stability

## Process

1) I began by merging the relevant datasets.
  
2) Next, I identified which areas of the business were generating profit versus those operating at a loss.
  
3) I then evaluated the effectiveness of advertising efforts during the companyâ€™s critical recovery phase.
   
4) Finally, I analyzed how product returns impacted overall profitability.


## Data 

The data was one Excel spreadsheet file provided by TripleTen:

- `Superstore.xls`: each row corresponds to one product sold; sheets were LEFT JOIN'd  
  - `orders`: details all fields for each ordered item  
  - `returns`: details all fields for each returned item
 
## Assumptions

1) Sales profits are currently showing a net loss.

2) This negative outcome appears to be driven by factors linked to both order activity and product returns.

3) Operational adjustments will be necessary to address inefficiencies and reduce losses.

4) Additionally, the advertising team would benefit from strategic recommendations to improve campaign effectiveness and overall ROI.

## Key Findings

1) Top-performing subcategories based on profit include Copiers, Phones, and Accessories, while Tables, Bookcases, and Supplies are contributing to the largest losses.

2) In terms of regional performance, Office Supplies and Technology generate strong profits in the West, whereas Office Supplies and Furniture are major loss drivers in the Central region.

3) Advertising efforts should be strategically focused by state and season, with campaigns in Indiana (October), Vermont (November), and Rhode Island (December).

4) Product returns are a critical issue, with some items being returned at rates as high as 100%, severely impacting profitability.

5) A number of customers also show return rates of up to 100%, indicating a need for improved return policies or customer targeting.

6) When comparing average profit against return rates, certain products are clearly not viable for continued sale, while many others require further evaluation.

## Recommendations

1) Focus marketing and development efforts on high-performing categories to sustain momentum in profit centers. Continue investing in strategies that enhance sales and customer engagement where the business is already thriving.

2) Perform in-depth analysis of loss-making products and categories, examining pricing, product quality, and operational efficiency. Discontinue items that consistently underperform to reduce financial drain.

3) Strategically allocate advertising budgets by targeting peak sales periods in specific states, using 20% of monthly profits as a guideline. Tailor campaigns to align with regional trends and customer preferences.

4) Address high return rates through detailed analysis of product and customer behavior, identifying patterns and implementing solutions such as improved quality control, clearer product descriptions, and loyalty initiatives to build trust and retention
