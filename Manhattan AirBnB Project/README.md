## Project Overview: 

This project was the first independent analysis I completed as part of the TripleTen Business Intelligence Analytics Program. It showcases my skills in advanced spreadsheet techniques and data-driven decision-making. Using real Airbnb listing data from Manhattan, NYC, I conducted in-depth analysis to help a client identify the most profitable vacation rental investment based on property type, location, and pricing trends. An 8 page google spreadsheet  featuring organized tabs, table of contents, executive summary, cleaned and processed datasets, interactive pivot tables, and visual insights through bar and pie charts. You can access the cleaned and processed file [HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zwB2ZrLlgm9qiAZPNZt3fdkrLzI40f7p-ygiL3GLIvw/edit?usp=sharing)


## Data Set:

The original data was one Google spreadsheet file provided by TripleTen, it includes: 

-	'data_dictionary': summary of field titles 

-	'listings': unique listings available with available data

-	'calendar': listings with upcoming availabilities

## Objectives
Our three main objectives were:
1.	Find the most popular neighborhoods in the greater NYC area based on reviews.
2.	In those top-3 neighborhoods, find the top-3 most popular rental size, which was based on the number of bedrooms.
3.	Identify the most profitable listings based on monthly expected income, and calculate an annual expected income for those properties.

## Process Overview
1.	Data Cleaning & Preparation:
Utilized filtering techniques to detect and resolve data inconsistencies. Non-essential columns were hidden to streamline the dataset. Advanced functions such as ISNUMBER, FIND, SUMIF, VLOOKUP and others were applied to format, structure, and enhance data accuracy.
2.	Neighborhood Performance Analysis:
Leveraged Pivot Tables to identify the highest-performing neighborhoods based on listing review frequency, providing insight into demand hotspots across Manhattan.
3.	Optimal Property Size Evaluation:
Assessed ideal property sizes per neighborhood using Pivot Tables, enhanced with conditional formatting to highlight standout segments for investment.
4.	Revenue Estimation:
Calculated estimated annual revenue for top listings, offering a data-backed foundation for investment decisions.
5.	Data Visualization:
Developed clear and informative bar charts to visually communicate key findings and trends throughout the dataset.
6.	Formatting & Readability:
Applied consistent formatting and structured layout to ensure the analysis is professional, navigable, and easy to interpret.
7.	Project Documentation:
Included organizational tools such as an Executive Summary, Table of Contents, Assumptions Log, and Change Log to provide transparency, context, and navigational ease for stakeholders


## Assumptions
1) Airbnb listings are assumed to be representative of the broader short-term vacation rental market in Manhattan.
2) The analysis focused only on properties with a minimum stay requirement of one week or less to reflect typical short-term rental behavior.
3) Listings without any reviews in the past year were treated as inactive and excluded from the analysis.
4) The number of reviews over the last 12 months was used as a proxy for a listing's popularity and booking frequency.
5) Extremely high-priced luxury listings and unusually low-priced units were removed to avoid skewing the results with outliers.

## Key Findings
1.	The top recommended neighborhoods for vacation rentals are as follows: Lower East Side, Hell's Kitchen, Harlem, Midtown, Upper West Side, Chelsea, East Village, East Harlem, West Village, Upper East Side.

2.	One-bedroom rentals are the most popular overall. In the Lower East Side, one-bedroom units are ideal to align with demand. Hells Kitchen shows a higher preference for two-bedroom properties, while Midtown renters tend to favor studio apartments

3.	The top-3 highest potential earning properties for a 30 day revenue were estimated to earn $29,940 (Midtown neighborhood), $26,100 (Hells kitchen neighborhood), and $22,800 (Lower east side neighborhood), respectively. The expected annual earnings for each property were $359,280, $313,200, and $273,600, respectively.

## Recommendations

1. Prioritize One-Bedroom Units in High-Demand Neighborhoods
Given the overall popularity of one-bedroom rentals, investors should focus on acquiring or converting properties into one-bedroom units in high-traffic areas like the Lower East Side to maximize occupancy and appeal.
2. Tailor Property Sizes to Neighborhood Preferences
Align property offerings with neighborhood-specific demand: invest in two-bedroom units for Hell’s Kitchen, where they perform best, and studio apartments in Midtown, where they attract the most interest. This approach improves occupancy rates and guest satisfaction.
3. Target High-Earning Neighborhoods for Premium Listings
Since Midtown, Hell’s Kitchen, and the Lower East Side show the highest earning potential, investors should prioritize premium, well-reviewed listings in these areas—ensuring quality amenities and competitive pricing to fully capitalize on revenue opportunities.
