## Project Background

This was an independent project used to demonstrate my Power BI skills.
The objective was to analyze the app ecosystem on the Shopify platform using data
collected from publicly available Shopify websites, with the goal of identifying the key factors that contribute to a Shopify appâ€™s success.

## Process

1) Began by analyzing the overall Shopify App Store landscape using KPI cards and visual charts to highlight key performance indicators.

2) Organized and visualized review data to evaluate customer feedback trends across apps.

3) Conducted an analysis of app developers, segmenting them by the types and volume of reviews they received.

## Data

The Excel file provided by TripleTen was a public data chosen from the Shopify App Store

- `Shopify.xls`: Excel workbook containing 4 sheets:   
  - `apps`: details all fields for each ordered item  
  - `apps_categories`: details all fields for each returned item
  -  `categories` : Categories of the apps. Each app has multiple categories
  -  `reviews` : Each review (row) contains information on user opinion about the related app (rating and comment). Also, it contains the response from the developer if present.

## Assumptions

1) The scraped data from Shopify websites is considered reliable and provides a representative view of the app ecosystem.

2) The shopify.xlsx file is well-structured, with consistent formatting and only minimal missing or inconsistent values.

3) The column names and data types are appropriately labeled and accurately describe the information contained in each table.
