## Project Background

This was my first project at TripleTen, where I had the opportunity to analyze user engagement data for Fresh Beats ðŸŽ¶, a dynamic online platform transforming the music industry. 

In this project, I compiled a concise stakeholder report summarizing key insights and growth trends from 2018 to 2023. The analysis highlights areas of success, such as the consistent rise in paid user engagement and the strong performance of the Indie and Pop genres. At the same time, it identifies opportunities for improvementâ€”particularly in boosting engagement within the Electronic and Hip Hop genres and converting more free users into paid subscribers.

The report concludes with data-driven recommendations focused on user growth, cross-genre engagement strategies, and targeted marketing effortsâ€”providing Fresh Beats with actionable insights to drive continued success and platform-wide growth
