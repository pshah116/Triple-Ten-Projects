## Project Background

This was my first project at TripleTen, where I had the opportunity to analyze user engagement data for Fresh Beats ðŸŽ¶, a dynamic online platform transforming the music industry. Fresh Beats generates revenue through partnerships with musical artists who pay for promotional services to reach a broader audience.While Fresh Beats has successed in promoting emerging musicians, there are strategic imperatives to optimize its operations and further enhance business performance such as artist promotion, user engagement and conversion, and genre promotion for emerging artists.

In this project, I compiled a concise stakeholder report summarizing key insights and growth trends from 2018 to 2023. The analysis highlights areas of success, such as the consistent rise in paid user engagement and the strong performance of the Indie and Pop genres. At the same time, it identifies opportunities for improvementâ€”particularly in boosting engagement within the Electronic and Hip Hop genres and converting more free users into paid subscribers.

## Executive Summary

The report concludes with data-driven recommendations focused on user growth, cross-genre engagement strategies, and targeted marketing effortsâ€”providing Fresh Beats with actionable insights to drive continued success and platform-wide growth. Drawing from data collected between 2018 and 2023, the analysis reflects a strong upward trend in user activity, particularly among paid users, and highlights the platformâ€™s ongoing growth across multiple genres. The findings emphasize the importance of strategic focus on underperforming areas to ensure balanced development across the platform. With paid users consistently showing higher levels of engagement, there is a clear opportunity to optimize conversion strategies for free users and strengthen engagement in less active genres. This report delivers actionable insights to support decision-making, enhance user experience, and contribute to the long-term growth and success of Fresh Beats as a leader in the music streaming industry.

## Recommendations

1) Explore Emerging Music Trends:
Launch focused marketing efforts and grow the music catalog specifically for Electronic and Hip-Hop genres to capture growing interest and boost engagement

2) Paid vs Free Users:
Introduce limited-time offers and flexible subscription tiers to encourage free users to upgrade. Leveraging popular features or high-performing genres can help drive continued user growth and convert free users to paid

3) Pop Genre Decline: 
Examine the factors contributing to the recent decline in Pop music engagement. Ask users their opinion on what their preferences are for artists and songs in Pop music to increase contribution

4) Promote Indie Genre:
Indie has consistently been successful with no users below 70 at all times throughout 2018-2023. Focus on continued growth and development  as this is the strongest genre
