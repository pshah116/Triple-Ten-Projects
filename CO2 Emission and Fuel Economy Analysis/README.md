## Project Overview

This was a Code Pudding project where we worked in teams to solve a real world problem. As a group we explored the relationship between fuel economy, CO2 emissions, and car features such as fuel type and drive type using a dataset containing vehicle specifications, CO2 emissions data, and fuel economy. We completed the project and presented it to the judges on tableau. This project analyzes the relationship between vehicle characteristics‚Äîsuch as drive type, fuel type, and engine size‚Äîand their impact on CO2 emissions and fuel economy. Using a real-world dataset of vehicle specifications, I performed data cleaning, we completed exploratory data analysis (EDA), and I built an interactive story dashboard in tableau to uncover environmental trends and highlight the efficiency of different vehicle types. The goal was to identify which types of vehicles are more environmentally friendly, investigate the rapid improvements in electric vehicles (EVs), and provide data-driven recommendations for consumers, and manufacturers aiming to reduce emissions and promote sustainable transportation.

## Executive Summary

 While conventional vehicles (orange line) have shown gradual improvement in average combined miles per gallon (MPG), the growth has been modest. In contrast, electric vehicles (blue line) have experienced a dramatic rise in average MPG equivalent, particularly after 2012, reflecting rapid advancements in EV technology, battery efficiency, and overall design. By 2025, EVs significantly outperform conventional vehicles in fuel efficiency, emphasizing the growing importance and viability of electric mobility in achieving sustainability and emission reduction goals
Key strategies to support the shift toward cleaner, more efficient vehicle technologies is needed. In this project with the data used, front-wheel and two-wheel drive systems are the best choices for the environment, alongside the importance of lightweight engine design across all drive types is critical. Hybrid alternatives are recommended for those needing AWD or 4WD to balance performance with environmental impact. The rising adoption of electric vehicles and the innovations driving their improved efficiency is growing at a rapid rate. Encourage EV use, discourage high-emission fuel types, and expand charging infrastructure are essential steps to support this transition. Together, these actions pave the way for a more sustainable and cost-effective future in the automotive industry.

## Data Set

The data set "Raw Data CO2 emission and fuel economy.xlsx" file contains all relevant data regarding vehicle types, fuel economy, and CO2 emissions used for our project presentation

## Tools Used

Excel- Data Cleaning

Tableau- Data visualization reporting

## Data Cleaning 
üßπ

I performed data cleaning in Excel to prepare the dataset for analysis:

-Removed duplicate records

-Handled missing data

-Applied Excel functions like IF, ROUNDUP, TRIM, PROPER, etc to standardize and format the data.

-Created new columns and formatted dates into the proper form (month/year)

This process ensured a clean, consistent dataset that could support meaningful insights.

## EDA & Storytelling 
üìä

After cleaning the data, we conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) and I built an interactive visual story in Tableau to uncover trends and relationships. The project focused on three main questions:

How has fuel economy changed over time?

How do fuel types differ in efficiency and environmental impact?

What influence does drive type (FWD, AWD, 4WD, etc.) and engine type have on fuel efficiency and CO2 output?

## Key Findings
 üåç 
 
1) The blue line is for electric vehicles (EVs) which have shown the most significant improvement in fuel economy since 1998, with drastically lower CO2 emissions.

2) Overall the best choice for average mileage and lowest CO2 emissions is Front wheel drive and a close second option is All wheel drive.

3) Drive type plays a major role in emissions, with 2-wheel and front-wheel drive being more environmentally friendly options. This data was included in the data set as a fuel efficiency score created by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The EPA creates protective standards to assess vehicle conditions according to multiple criterias to determine their impact on the environment

4) Along with drive type, the engine type also plays an important role also with helping the environment reduce CO2 emissions. 4 cylinder vehicles have the lowest CO2 emissions on average  ![2025-04-02_11h16_26](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2d1dfc44-c8c1-4ed8-b84c-72150b8eb240)


## Recommendations 
‚úÖ

Recommendations for drive type:
1) Promote and encourage use and development of Front-Wheel Drive and 2-Wheel Drive platforms for companies and consumers focused on fuel efficiency and emissions reduction.
2) Prioritize lightweight vehicle design and smaller engines across all drive types especially in 4WD and AWD models. Lighter vehicles consume less fuel and emit less CO2 and more cost efficient to manufacture
3) If you need the traction and power of AWD or 4WD, look for models that offer hybrid options, this will help the environment much more rather than getting a fully gas powered vehicle

Recommendations for Trend in Fuel Economy over the years:

1) Investigate the growing adoption of electric vehicles by analyzing how many users are making the shift to EVs year over year, and identify which manufacturers are leading this transition

2) Explore the key factors behind the rapid improvement in EV fuel economy such as advancements in electric motors, battery efficiency, or weight reduction to understand what‚Äôs driving innovation

Recommendations for fuel type: 
1) Encourage electric vehicle adoption due to better efficiency and zero CO2 emissions

2) Disincentivize high-emission fuel types: Gas cars could be more subject to taxes, and higher prices are also more harmful to the environment

3) Invest in infrastructure: expand charging stations to support more electric vehicles
