## Project Background

This independent project was created to demonstrate the skills I developed in Business Analytics. The goal was to transform the company’s raw transaction data into meaningful business metrics by analyzing event logs and extracting actionable insights.

## Executive Summary

This analysis focused on the company’s conversion funnel and customer retention performance. While a fair number of users moved from viewing products to adding them to their cart, far fewer completed their purchases, indicating a significant drop-off at the final stage of the funnel. Customer retention also declined sharply after the initial month. To address these challenges, the report recommends improving the checkout experience, enhancing customer loyalty through personalized campaigns and support, gathering feedback to better understand user needs, and continuing to track behavioral trends for future optimization.

## Description 
-8 page google spreadsheet including raw data, table of contents, executive summary, pivot tables, cleaned and processed data, and data analysis

## Process
1) began by exploring, filtering, and cleaning the dataset to ensure accuracy and consistency.

2) developed a conversion funnel to analyze user behavior through the purchase journey.
   
3) prepared the data for cohort analysis and calculated retention rates to track user engagement over time.
  
4) Refined the formatting and organized the documentation to ensure the final report was clear and accessible for the client.


## Data

The data was provided by Triple Ten as 1 google spreadsheet

the data includes:

-raw_user_activity: Contains individual user interactions on the company’s website, with each row representing a single event.

-user_id: A unique identifier assigned to each customer.

-event_type: Describes the specific action a user took (e.g., view, add to cart, purchase).

-category_code: Indicates the product category associated with the user’s activity.

-brand: Refers to the manufacturer or brand of the product.

-price: The cost of the product in U.S. dollars.

-event_date: The date the activity occurred, formatted as YYYY-MM-DD.

-Table of Contents: A preformatted blank sheet 

-Executive Summary: A preformatted blank sheet intended for summarizing key insights and conclusions.

## Assumptions

1) The "raw_user_activity" sheet contains all user interactions on the website within the specified timeframe.

2) Any missing data or irregularities are minimal and not significant enough to impact the analysis.

3) The structure and formatting of the dataset, including column names and data types, are accurate and consistently maintained.

## Key Findings

1) High Drop-Off After Viewing:

While over 10,000 unique users viewed products, only about 29% added items to their cart, indicating a significant drop-off between interest and purchase intent.

2) Purchase Completion Rate from Cart is Moderate:

Of the users who added items to their cart, approximately 36% completed a purchase, suggesting room for improvement in the checkout experience or buyer confidence.

3) Overall Conversion is Low:

The total conversion from initial product view to completed purchase is just 10.34%, highlighting a need to optimize the full conversion funnel, especially the transition from viewing to cart.

## Recommendations

1) Investigate drop-off points in the conversion funnel to reduce cart abandonment—determine whether the product page or checkout process contributes more to user drop-off.

2) Optimize user experience by streamlining high-friction areas in the shopping journey based on funnel performance data.

3) Boost customer engagement and retention through targeted marketing strategies like personalized offers, loyalty programs, and enhanced customer support.

4) Collect and analyze user feedback to gain deeper insights into customer needs and tailor future improvements more effectively.

5) Maintain continuous cohort tracking to monitor shifts in user behavior and adjust strategies accordingly with real-time data.
